Agent: Thank you for calling Lumina Aesthetics, this is Chloe. How can I help you glow today?

Customer: Hi Chloe, I was looking into getting CoolSculpting done. Specifically for my lower stomach area. Do you guys have availability for that this week?

Agent: We certainly do! That is one of our most popular treatments. Have you been to Lumina before, or would this be your first visit?

Customer: It’s my first time. My friend Jessica referred me, she said you guys are great.

Agent: That is so sweet of her, make sure to tell her thanks! So, for CoolSculpting, because every body is different, we actually require a 30-minute assessment first to see how many applicators you’ll need. We can't give you an exact price over the phone, but cycles usually start at around $750. Is that within your budget?

Customer: Oh, okay. Yeah, that sounds about right. My main worry is the downtime. I have a wedding to go to in Florida in about 10 days. Will I be bruised?

Agent: That is a very valid concern. To be honest, with CoolSculpting, you might have some swelling or tenderness for a week or two, and full results actually take about 1 to 3 months to show. If you need immediate results for the wedding, we might want to look at something else, like maybe a lymphatic drainage massage or EmSculpt.

Customer: Hmm. Okay. You know what, let's just do the consult for the CoolSculpting. If it's too risky for the wedding, I'll wait until after.

Agent: That sounds like a smart plan. I have an opening for a consultation this Thursday at 4:00 PM or Friday morning at 10:00 AM.

Customer: Friday at 10:00 AM works. Do I need to pay anything now?

Agent: We do require a $50 deposit to hold the consultation slot, which goes towards your treatment cost. I can take that card over the phone whenever you’re ready.

Customer: Sure, it's a Visa. The number is 4147...
