Agent: Thanks for calling Neucler Auto, this is James.
Customer: Hi, I'm looking to get a quote for a timing belt replacement on my 2018 Subaru Outback.
Agent: I can certainly help with that. Have you been to our shop before?
Customer: No, this would be my first time.
Agent: Welcome! Let me just get your full name and phone number to start a file.
Customer: Sure, it's Sarah Connor, 555-0199.
Agent: Thanks Sarah. For the 2018 Outback, the timing belt package usually runs about $850, which includes the water pump and tensioners. Is the car currently running okay?
Customer: Yeah it runs fine, just hit 100k miles so I know it's due.
Agent: Smart to get ahead of it. We have openings this Thursday or Friday morning.
Customer: Friday morning works best for me.
Agent: Great, I'll put you down for Friday at 8 AM. We'll need about 5-6 hours.
Customer: Perfect, thanks James.
Agent: You're welcome, see you Friday!
